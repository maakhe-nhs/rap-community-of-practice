| Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP).  RAPs bring together a number of good  practices to help ensure all published  statistics meet the highest standards of  transparency and reproducibility. | "Reproducible research allows others to learn from your work. Scientific research has a  steep learning curve, and allowing others to  access data and code gives them a head  start on performing similar analyses."  - Alston and Rick, 2021 | By adopting the use of modern, open source  programming languages (Python, SQL) and moving away  from outdated proprietary tools (SPSS, Excel).                                                                        |
| There are levels to RAP. These levels  aim to offer teams a recommended  maturity map for adopting RAP practices.                                                                                   | Over time, analytical work in NHSD and across  government is expected to adopt the RAP  practices in order to meet the standards set  out in the Aqua Book.                                                                                    | By using [git](/rap-community-of-practice/development-approach/01_intro-to-git) version control and github/gitlab to keep  a record of the code and documentation should it need  updating and also for other teams to learn from and  critique. |

There  is an associated MS Teams page. You can also ask  issues directly by opening an issue on the repo.          |
