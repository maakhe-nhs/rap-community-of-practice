| Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP). <br>RAPs bring together a number of good <br>practices to help ensure all published <br>statistics meet the highest standards of <br>transparency and reproducibility. | "Reproducible research allows others to learn<br>from your work. Scientific research has a <br>steep learning curve, and allowing others to <br>access data and code gives them a head <br>start on performing similar analyses." <br>- Alston and Rick, 2021 | By adopting the use of modern, open source <br>programming languages (Python, SQL) and moving away <br>from outdated proprietary tools (SPSS, Excel).                                |
| There are levels to RAP. These levels <br>aim to offer teams a recommended <br>maturity map for adopting RAP practices.                                                                                         | Over time, analytical work in NHSD and across <br>government is expected to adopt the RAP <br>practices in order to meet the standards set <br>out in the Aqua Book.                                                                                          | By using version control (git/github/gitlab) to keep <br>a record of the code and documentation should it need <br>updating and also for other teams to learn from and <br>critique. |
