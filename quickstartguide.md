| [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](/what-is-RAP.md),  RAPs, bring together a number of good  practices to help ensure all published  statistics meet the highest standards of  transparency and reproducibility. | "Reproducible research allows others to learn from your work. Scientific research has a  steep learning curve, and allowing others to  access data and code gives them a head  start on performing similar analyses."  - Alston and Rick, 2021 | By adopting the use of modern, open source  programming languages and libraries  (eg. Databricks, Pyspark for Python and SQL),  moving away from outdated manual processes and  getting started using the [thin slice strategy](/rollout-approach/thin-slice-strategy.md). |
| There are levels to RAP.
